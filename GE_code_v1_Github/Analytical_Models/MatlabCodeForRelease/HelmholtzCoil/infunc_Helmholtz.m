% Function that computes the influence matrices of an array of coil actuators located inside an Helmholtz coil
%
% INPUTS:
%     actuator: Matrix containing the coil actuator geometry (nloops x 2)
%               where nloops is the number of loops that the coil is made of,
%               1st column is the ith loop radius, and 2nd column is the ith loop z position
%         nact: Number of actuators in the array (scalar)
%       ax, ay: x and y coordinates of the actuators on the array in unit of the actuator diameter (1 x nact vectors)
% xdata, ydata: x and y coordinates at which the influence is calculated (vectors)
%               * Use Matlab meshgrid function to create matrices then transpose to vectors
%               * Number of data points is np
% OUTPUTS:
%         infBx, infBy, infBz: Magnetic field influence functions (np x nact)  
%   bx_coil, by_coil, bz_coil: Values of the magnetic field components created by the Helmholtz coil (1 x np)
