 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 36 and contact element type 35 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 35.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 ANSYS will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.

 The Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the in-core memory     
 mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to      
 avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most often        
 results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if      
 enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver      
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to
