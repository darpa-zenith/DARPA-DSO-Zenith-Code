03- 2D Flat Halbach

This code is used to compute the magnetic flux density, magnetic potential, and the kelvin body force
distribution of a 2D flat Halbach array as a function of the Halbach arrayâ€™s parameters. The code
approximates the magnets as infinite current sheets going in and out of the side of the magnet and only
accounts for the magnetic potential
