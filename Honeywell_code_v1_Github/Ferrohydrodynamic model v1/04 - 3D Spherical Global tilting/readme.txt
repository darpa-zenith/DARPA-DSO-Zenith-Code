v1.0 3D Spherical Global tilting

The 3D spherical global tilting code determines the shape of the equipotential ferrofluid surface on a
three-dimensional spherical Halbach array as a function of the tilting angles and the ferrofluid properties.
Following the superposition principle, the full-physics solution of the surface wave (Sec. 1.2.4) is super-
posed to the equipotential line. This informs the design of active control mechanisms through optical
characterization. Both 2D and 3D plots of the ferrofluid surface are generated, and superimposed on
the dish and Halbach array outline.
The ferrofluid surface is calculated by varying the central height of the ferrofluid until the ferrofluid
volume (generated by integrating the equipotential line corresponding to the chosen central point)
matches that without tilting.
